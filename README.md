# 🛡️ Linux Log Monitoring & Alert System  

## 📌 Overview  
This Python script monitors Linux system logs (e.g., `/var/log/auth.log`) and detects suspicious activity such as:  
- Failed SSH login attempts  
- Unauthorized root access  
- Possible brute force attacks  

When suspicious activity is found, an **email alert** is sent to the configured recipient.
